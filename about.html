    <h1>About me</h1>
    <span>Hi there, my name is Thomas Vilhena ðŸ˜„<br><br>I'm a Software Engineer that enjoys taking part in all software development life-cycle phases.<br><br>Driven by quality, I believe incremental development and early testing are the best way towards more reliable, maintainable and better architectured systems. I'm currently working as the Lead Software Engineer at MindMiners, a web/mobile market research startup I co-founded in 2014, but my past experience also includes Airline systems development, low level programming for embedded systems and even digital hardware design.<br><br>I suppose my Systems Engineering degree gives me a broader view on today's technology, from the hardware to the software, and enables me to quickly adapt to new assignments and technologies.<br><br>Feel free to get in touch at thomas [dot] vilhena [at] gmail [dot] com</span>
