In an ideal world software developers would only work on tasks from a perfectly refined product backlog. Tasks requirements, user stories, user flows, interface designs, edge cases, etc would be thoroughly detailed, allowing for maximum productivity during development since all required information would be easy to access and readily available.

In practice this is rarely the case. Backlog refinement is an important but often neglected process. Below I provide a commom definition of what it is:

> Backlog refinement is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they are planned for development

It can be regarded as a specification process somewhat perpendicular to the software development process, i.e., backlog refinement is driven by the product vision, fit to technical constraints and performed concurrently and in anticipation of development:

  <br>
</p>

Typical signs of a deficient product backlog are:

1. Lack of user stories detailing what a feature should do
1. Missing interface designs defining what a feature should look like
1. Absence of relevant non-functional requirements (ex: performance, technology stack, etc)

In the absence of information developers are faced with two choices, either halt development and switch to another task, or work to fill in the gaps themselves to make the task completion feasible. This latter  approach can be dangerous if not handled properly, since strategic product decisions could be left open and done on the fly without oversight. Here enters the mindset of the <b>consultant developer</b>, which I propose as a solution to mitigate the risks of a deficient product backlog and improve development productivity.

A consultant developer is expected to work collaboratively within the organization taking part not only of a software project's technical scope, but also get involved in its business scope as well.

Larger organizations usually have the resources to build fully featured specialized business and technical teams. A deficient product backlog in this case will most likely be the result of problematic internal processes or underperforming professionals.

Some medium and most small organizations, specially early stage startups, don't have the resources to maintain these fully featured teams, and team members are often required to hold multiple responsibilities, of both business and technical scopes.

In this context consultant developers are most valuable. Put simply, they are software developers that take backlog items to work on and ensure they <b>i)</b> capture business value, <b>ii)</b> have clear acceptance criteria and <b>iii)</b> are technically feasible before starting development. They collaborate with stakeholders giving technical and user experience design advice when needed, which (most) developers naturally acquire over the years working in different projects. They are driven by delivering value to end users on a regular basis, helping set the pace of the product development process.

Agile processes (ex: Scrum) dictates that developers should be shielded from external influences and interruptions as to leverage their productivity. While this is true, it doesn't mean the development team should be prevented from reaching out stakeholders when needed, mainly internal ones, in the context of a single backlog item, to clear the path for development. As a bonus software developers employing this mindset will grow their vision of the product and potentially perceive their work as more useful and meaningful.
